# bbcsport-topic-classification-transformers-llms
Comparative study of supervised Transformer fine-tuning and zero-shot LLM prompting for multi-class BBCSport classification.

This notebook investigates modern NLP paradigms for multi-class topic classification by contrasting encoder-only Transformer fine-tuning (DistilBERT) with prompt-based inference using instruction-tuned LLMs. Through controlled evaluation on BBCSport, including stratified supervised training and balanced subset LLM benchmarking, the study analyzes accuracy, generalization behavior, and the practical limitations of large-scale generative models in structured classification tasks.
